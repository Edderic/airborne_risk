Some of us use CO2 readings as a proxy for risk of inhaling bioaerosols such as SARS-CoV-2, and that’s what I’ll be focusing on here. Using the knowledge we’ve gained throughout the pandemic, we can help others make good choices about how to protect themselves from potentially lethal and/or disabling pathogens.\n",

    "It would be beneficial for us to track individuals that a susceptible is exposed to. The cumulative risk over a day can have large fluctuations depending on the situation of the individual. Scenarios where the individual sees a bunch of different people regularly over the course of the day (e.g. waiter at a restaurant) can be higher risk than seeing a small amount of people in a longer time range (e.g. spending time with coworkers in an office). The \"waiter\" scenario is easier to collect data for (since we don't need to track IDs), we just need to estimate occupancy somehow. The \"office\" scenario, on the other hand, can also be a common experience. If we treat the latter scenario like the former, we'll be overestimating the risk. It can make a big difference (e.g. 120974 vs. 71439 MicroCOVIDs for about 1-day worth of exposure), at least in this quick experiment.\n"
